DynamoRIO Runner Recipe
===================================

This directory contains the files required to deploy DynamoRIO and the plugin to 
the relevant directories in Petalinux.

This uses the "inherit_package" directive to deploy the library and plugin
to the correct folder. "dynamorio-1.0.tar.gz" untars to /usr/share/dynamorio
the contents of the folder.

Note that because of the required structure of DynamoRIO, petalinux-build
will warn that the libraries are in the wrong directory, but this directory
structure is required by DynamoRIO.

"drrun" is used to dynamically instrument the binary given. The plugin,
libcfiplugin.so, implements syscall filtering and shadow stack to prevent
exploitation of the given game. For more information, please find the 
source at "files/plugin/cfi_plugin.c". Note that DynamoRIO is required 
compile the program.
