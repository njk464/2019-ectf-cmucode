/* This password hashing algorithm was designed by David Mazieres

 * 1. state := InitState ()
 * 2. state := ExpandKey (state, salt, password)
 * 3. REPEAT rounds:
 *      state := ExpandKey (state, 0, password)
 *	state := ExpandKey (state, 0, salt)
 * 4. ctext := "OrpheanBeholderScryDoubt"
 * 5. REPEAT 64:
 * 	ctext := Encrypt_ECB (state, ctext);
 * 6. RETURN Concatenate (salt, ctext);
